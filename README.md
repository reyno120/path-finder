# Path-Finder
This project visualizes the shortest distance between a start point and an end point using Dijkstra's algorithm.

To get started, simply run npm start.

To change your start and end point, use the start and end flag buttons to the left.
To draw "walls" between your two points, select the wall button.
To knock down "walls" choose the hammer button.

Once you're ready, hit run!
